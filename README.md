# 01moduleChallenge

In this challenge, you will refactor a marketing website so that the site is accessible. You will work to clean up the code base and ensure that the CSS styling sheet is organized as expected, and that semantic HTML is being utilized throughout the code base.

## Instructions

Follow this user story: "AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines"

## Acceptance Criteria

"GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title"


## Sample Page

"note
This layout is designed for "desktop", so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the Mock-Up when viewed at a resolution smaller than 768px. In future lessons, you will learn how to make elements "responsive" so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:"
